#Template Modular Sinatra App

##Implementation Steps
1. First search the project for 'ReplaceWithName' and name your app!
  * This will rename all of the namespaces as well as make the title of your app in the `views/layout.erb`
2. Bundle install
3. `rake db:create` (comes with ActiveRecord)
4. Good to go!

## Out Of The Box Configuration
* Postgres and ActiveRecord
* Foundation
* ActiveSupport
* Pony for emails
* Rspec/Capybara for testing
